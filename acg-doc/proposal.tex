\begin{abstract}

In the growing times where software are moving towards parallelism, new schemes
have to be reprogrammed to utilize multiple core powers.Toon shading, a
non-photo-realistic rendering popularized by Sega's Jet Grind Radio, would
particularly benefit from this movement.The graphical technique requires a
number of pre-calculation based on the model's properties, such as material and
a specialized one-dimensional texture.With this in mind, a parallel system
would very easily optimize cell shading rendition to its best efficiency.

While numerous works created their own unique graphical style, we'll be working
with the ``watercolor'' style seen in games: cel-shading (also known as hard
shading) without bold outlines.There are a few examples of this style in
games, including Grasshopper Manufacture's No More Heroes and Nintendo's Legend
of Zelda: The Wind Waker.Due to the time constraint, the outline rendering
common in cel-shaded games will not be implemented. As our mentioned games
shown, humans are still capable of perceiving depth on cel-shaded graphics
without borders.Shadows will be used as the depth indicator instead, and if
we have enough time, we may add atmospheric perspective as well.

Goal-wise, we'll initially begin with a simple single dimension texture
implementation found in the paper below, Stylized Rendering Techniques For
Real-Time 3D Animation, and the shadow rendition, Shadows for Cel Animation.
If time permits, we would also like to try the two dimensional texture
extension from Barla et al.\shortcite{barla2006xte} The intended style, though,
may differ from the pencil sketch version the document mentions.

\item
An incredibly popular paper describing three distinct techniques on rendering
flat, cartoon-like graphics efficiently.The first technique implements a
flexible method of shading flat colors, using a one dimensional texture and a
simple calculation used on all vertexes.It crudely rounds the surface and
lighting direction normals to map shades to the model.The second method uses
the same implementation as the first technique, except using separate textures
as shades rather than color.The third part describes a method of creating
bold outlines on sharp edges to further imply flatness on the
model.\cite{lake2000srt}

\item
An extension to the engine mentioned in Intel's Stylized Rendering Techniques
For Real-Time 3D Animation that portrays the atmospheric perspective (an art
technique devised by Leonardo Da Vinci) by using a two dimensional shade
texture instead of one dimensional.The added dimension corresponds to the
distance from the camera.The paper further adds directional shading as well.
Rather than always having the light come from a point source, their algorithm
also adds a specific shading orientation (such as vertical, horizontal, or
circular) as well to create a variety of effects, including
back-lighting.\cite{barla2006xte}

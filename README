To build for the first time, one can just run `make` Once make has been run on
this directory, it will clobber the usual makeile, to rebuild the project on a
different computer/architecture run:

$ cmake .
$ make

To execute, run:
src/render -input OBJECT -output IMAGE [OPTIONS]...

Where the options are:

-size W H
	Sets width and height of image.

	W and H are integer values.
	Default is (100, 100).

-num_shadow_samples N
	Sets the number of times each ray will sample a
	shadow.

	Default is 0.

-num_bounces N
	Sets the number of times the ray can reflect off of
	a reflective surface.

	Default is 0.

-num_glossy_samples N
        Sets the number of times each ray will sample a
	glossy surface.

        Default is 0.

-background_color R G B
	Sets the background color, using the red, green,
	and blue values.

	R, G, and B are float values, betweeon 0 and 1.
	Default is (1, 1, 1).

-cam_pos X Y Z
	Sets the camera position.

	X, Y, and Z are float values.

-cam_dir X Y Z
	Sets the coordinates where the camera will be facing.
	For example, if X, Y, and Z are 0's, the camera will
	be looking at the center of the mesh.

	X, Y, and Z are float values.

	Note: if -cam_pos and -cam_dir are at the same coord-
	inates, the camera will be placed at a default
	position.

-cam_ori X Y Z
	Sets the camera's angle.

	X, Y, and Z are float values.
	Default is (0, 1, 0).

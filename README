Major bullet point review, I'll send a larger one when I get home. Sorry the
cab is coming in approximately 10 minutes

Basic ray casting is done happily. Shadows and such are just as described in
the lecture notes with little variation. The glossy is done by taking the
primal reflection ray, and adding a random vector that is found from
multiplying the roughness times a random value in [0, 1) in each coordinate. 

Extra credit:
Soft shadows are implemented much like glossy reflections.
Soft shadows are parallel
Glossy Reflections are Parallel


Radiosity:
I used a simple Monte Carlo method and did a full matrix iteration each time.
The randomness seems much more random than the results on the assignment but
results are generally satisfactory except for a few pocket cases. Occlusion is
done much like soft shadows, thus any number of sample points are allowable
